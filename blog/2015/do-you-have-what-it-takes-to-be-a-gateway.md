# Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Gateway?

We're proud to announce the first release of our new Gateway Guide, a comprehensive manual to operating a gateway in the Ripple network. Whether you're trying to understand how a gateway makes revenue, or how to use the authorized accounts feature, or even just what a warm wallet is, the gateway guide has you covered.

The guide comes with step-by-step, diagrammed explanations of typical gateway operations, a hefty list of precautions to make your gateway safer, and concrete examples of all the API calls you need to perform in order to get your gateway accounts set up and secure.

We're proud of all the work we've done to make the business of running a gateway easier, but there's still more work to do. If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, please send feedback to <developers@ripple.com> - or post it on our forums. We'd love to hear from you!

> _Editor's note, 2025: This guide is now obsolete and removed. For the nearest modern equivalent, see the [Stablecoin Issuer use case](/docs/use-cases/tokenization/stablecoin-issuer)._
