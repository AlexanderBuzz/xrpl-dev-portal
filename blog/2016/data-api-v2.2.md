# Data API v2.2 Released

The Data team is proud to announce the release of the [Ripple Data API v2.2](https://github.com/ripple/rippled-historical-database/releases/tag/v2.2.0)! This release includes lots of new features, including a total of 15 new methods, improvements in data quality, and documentation.

One of the biggest changes in the new version is the incorporation of data relating to the Ripple network itself. This includes expanded information on validator reports, network topology, and the XRP transaction costs currently being paid to the network. You can interact with all of the new methods using our Data API Tool.

Also part of the new release is a method to calculate the distribution of XRP from Ripple (the company) to others, along with the total amount of XRP in existence. The XRP Portal is already using the new method to report the most recent totals automatically.

For more information, check out the following resources:

_\[Update: Data API docs and Data visualizations on Ripple Charts are no longer available. The links have been removed.\]_

We look forward to seeing what you developers can do with all this data!
