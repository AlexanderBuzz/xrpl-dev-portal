# fix1578 is Now Available

[As previously announced](/blog/2019/fix1578-expected.md), the fix1578 amendment [became enabled on the XRP Ledger](https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/transactions/7A80C87F59BCE6973CBDCA91E4DBDB0FC5461D3599A8BC8EAD02FA590A50005D) on 2019-03-23.

## Action Required

- If you operate a `rippled` server, you should upgrade to version 1.2.0 (or higher) immediately. Version 1.2.2 is recommended.

For instructions on upgrading `rippled` on supported platforms, see [Install `rippled`](/docs/infrastructure/installation).


## Impact of Not Upgrading

If you operate a `rippled` server on a version older than 1.2.0, then your server is now amendment blocked, meaning that your server:

* Cannot determine the validity of a ledger
* Cannot submit or process transactions
* Does not participate in the consensus process
* Does not vote on future amendments
* Could rely on potentially invalid data

## fix1578 Summary

Changes the result codes returned by two transaction types:

- Changes the [OfferCreate transaction](/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/offercreate.md) to return a new result code, `tecKILLED`, if the offer used the `tfFillOrKill` flag and was killed. Without this amendment, the offer is killed but the transaction result is `tesSUCCESS`.
- Changes the [TrustSet transaction](/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/trustset.md) to fail with `tecNO_PERMISSION` if it tries to enable the [NoRipple flag](/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/rippling#the-no-ripple-flag) but cannot because the trust line has a negative balance. Without this amendment, the transaction does not enable the NoRipple flag, but the transaction result is `tesSUCCESS` nonetheless.
